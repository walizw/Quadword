Quadword is a little website I built for myself, to write about things I liked,
things I wanted to "/teach/" people, and because I also wanted to have a little
space in the internet for my things.

It all started as a very simple blog where there was only one author - not even
templates for posts/pages/blog/search or anything like that. It was just
organised with categories, with time I started adding things, until one day I
started to rewrite Quadword so more people other than me, can upload their
free - as in freedom content.

Quadword is an open space for anyone that wants to write, in the *Contributing*
top menu there is a lot of information on how you can do so, how you can add
yourself as a Quadword author, how to start publishing entries, how to create
categories, tags and your own pages here.

I hope you like Quadword \o/
