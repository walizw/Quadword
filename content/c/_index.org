* C

This section includes some guides/tutorials of the C programming language, they
are designed in a way you can go through each one of them lineally as if they
were a course or a book, or you can just read whatever you think you may need.

The contents are splitten in two categories:

- Beginners
- Advanced

The contents of both categories are just personal opinion on what I consider
beginner-friendly and advanced C is.
