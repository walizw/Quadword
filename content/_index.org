Hello everyone, welcome to Quadword!

Quadword is a little site of mine where I post about certain topics I personally
like, in a way where you can learn about them as well. I am a lot into low-level
programming, so that might be the main focus of writing here, as well as some
other personal topics or stuff that I might want to write in the future, who
knows.

I have a lot of ideas to write about, such as C and assembly programming,
kernels, compilers and interpreters development so, if you are into that kind of
stuff as well, keep an eye on here so you don't miss any post!
