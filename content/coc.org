* Code of Conduct

The code of conduct for Quadword and any other project I can have in the future
is very simple and can be summarised in just one rule:

- There are no rules.

I don't think that it's necessary a document telling you what to do, and what
not to do, we are all humans, right? and what do we do to humans (and pretty
much and living being) ? we respect them, so above anything, respect.
