Helloo, I am walizw (but you can call me Sara :D)

I am the creator and maintainer of Quadword. I am a lot into programming,
actually, I've been coding for more than half of my life (as I started when I
was 8). I write in Quadword about programming and some other low-level topics
(which is the subject of programming I enjoy the most). I will keep everything
free for everyone \o/
